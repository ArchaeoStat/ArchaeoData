## Overview

Datasets for chronological modelling with
[**ArchaeoPhases**](https://github.com/ArchaeoStat/ArchaeoPhases). This
package provides models and data to reproduce results from
**ArchaeoPhases** examples and vignettes.

## Installation

The size of this package is considerably over the 5 MB limit imposed by
CRAN. You can install the latest version of **ArchaeoData** from [our
repository](https://archaeostat.r-universe.dev) with:

``` r
install.packages("ArchaeoData", repos = "https://archaeostat.r-universe.dev")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ArchaeoStat/ArchaeoData")
```

## Local usage

``` r
## Load package
library(ArchaeoData)

## Load data (BCal output)

```

- [ChronoModel](http://www.chronomodel.fr) v2.0.18 project files and
  output files (in the `chronomodel/` subdirectory).
- [OxCal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html) v4.4.4 script and output
  files (in the `oxcal/` subdirectory).
